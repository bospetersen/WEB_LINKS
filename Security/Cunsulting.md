### [voatz.com - Security is our top priority](https://voatz.com/security-and-technology/)
Democracy requires secure elections and results you can verify and trust.

#### End-to-End Encryption
Data is encrypted across all areas of our platform, from the voter’s smartphone through transmission to the Voatz servers, and while at rest on secure storage.
Paper Trail & Secure Digital Receipts
Every ballot produces a paper trail, and every voter receives a post-vote ballot receipt. With these trails, election administrators can verify, print and audit all ballots prior to tabulation.

#### Blockchain Storage
All votes are secured on multiple, restricted-access, geographically-distributed servers running on blockchain technology to ensure all election data remains tamperproof.

#### Biometric Verification
Our app uses facial recognition technology to verify your identity, then pairs it to your phone’s security PIN or biometric key. This maintains voter privacy, and your data is never stored or shared.

#### Risk Assessment & Audits
We routinely undergo rigorous, independent third-party penetration testing, network architecture assessments, and mobile code analyses to safeguard against cybersecurity threats.

#### Data Security & Privacy
We follow best practices to protect data throughout the voting process. Our identity verification partners are certified as compliant, and all voter personally identifiable information is deleted upon successful verification.
