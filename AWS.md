# Cloud Advantages - AWS Summaries

The previous lectures (video: 1-9) explained various key cloud computing benefits.

For the Cloud Practitioner certification exam, you should know these benefits and also the benefits / explanations mentioned by AWS itself: [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-overview/six-advantages-of-cloud-computing.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-overview/six-advantages-of-cloud-computing.html)

These benefits are of course related to the explanations from the previous lectures. But in the exam, you will meet terms like "economies of scale" or "trade fixed expense for variable expense". Don't get confused by these terms! Instead, remember the explanations from the videos and the above-linked web page!

MUST READ

This whitepaper is an excellent source as it summarizes all core concepts & services you must know to pass the Cloud Practitioner exam: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-overview/introduction.html (note: it also covers services you don't need to know - but it does provide brief summaries for all the key services as well).

---

Also consider exploring the service overview pages of key AWS services - like the overview page for the Trusted Advisor service: https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/technology/trusted-advisor/

The brief summaries you find on those pages help a lot with answering the exam questions - especially combined with all the knowledge you gained throughout this course.

The same is true for some key AWS marketing pages that you should visit and study:
